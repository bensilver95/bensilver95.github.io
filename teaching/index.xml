      <description>In Fall 2024, I will be teaching an original undergraduate seminar, via the Columbia Teaching Scholars program.

The course focuses on the intersection between Psychology research and the Internet. The first half of the course explores how the Internet can serve as a new tool/methodology/data source to ask classic psychology questions.</description>
