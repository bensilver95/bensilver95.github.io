      <description>Instructor of record Research Methods: Data Science, Justice, and Social Change Term: Fall 2025 Lead Instructor: Me! Course Details: This course provides the rigorous data science training and core content knowledge students need to use data science to effect policy changes that promote a more just society.

      <title>Original Syllabus</title>

      <description>In Fall 2024, I taught an original undergraduate seminar called Psychology and the Internet, via the Columbia Teaching Scholars program.
You can view an interactive version of the syllabus here. Certain elements of the syllabus (such as some course topics and policies) were intentionally kept open to incorporate student input and so were changed once the semester began. You can view the original version of the syllabus, without student input, here.</description>
