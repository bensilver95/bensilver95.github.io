</ul>
<p><strong>Course Details</strong>: The course focuses on the intersection between Psychology research and the Internet. The first half of the course explores how the Internet can serve as a new tool/methodology/data source to ask classic psychology questions. The midterm assignment asks students to create a programming tutorial that explains how to access and work with one type of Internet data (i.e. social media, Reddit, search).  The second half of the course focuses on new psychological questions that arise in an environment that is as complex and novel as the Internet. The final assignment asks students to write an op-ed suggesting a new regulation for the Internet, based on psychological theories.</p>
