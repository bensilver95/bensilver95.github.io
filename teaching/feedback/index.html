      Teaching feedback

      So what do people actually think about me?

  <div class="post-content">
  <p>Included on this page is student feedback from four courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychology and the Internet, developed course and was instructor of record (Fall 2024)</li>
<li>Research Methods, lab section instructor/TA to Professor Kevin Ochsner (two sections in Fall 2022 and one section in Spring 2022)</li>
<li>Research Methods, lab section instructor/TA to Professor Niall Bolger (Spring 2021, on Zoom during COVID-19)</li>
</ul>
<p>I divide my feedback into two sections, based on feedback topic. For each section, I provide a brief note about why this topic of feedback is important to me, followed by several quotes from student evaluations. For each evaluation, I note the course that it comes from. At the end, I provide quantitative data about my teaching from each course.</p>
<p>You can find full evaluation data for all courses at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h3 id="attention-to-students-needs-and-responsiveness-to-feedback">Attention to students&rsquo; needs and responsiveness to feedback</h3>
<p>The single most important thing to me as an instructor is that my students feel that our classroom is a welcoming space for them, where it&rsquo;s okay to answer questions and be wrong, where they feel valued and listened to. In particular, I want students who are struggling with class material to feel like our classroom is a place where they can find guidance and support. I strive for this welcoming environment to be felt by all students equally, regardless of identity. I also deeply value student feedback - for each course I&rsquo;ve taught, I&rsquo;ve worked with Columbia&rsquo;s Center for Teaching and Learning to receive a mid-course review, in which my students provide feedback on the course to a CTL representative.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Ben is a wonderful TA who clearly cares very much about his students and the material he is teaching. He is super receptive to feedback and always tries his best to gauge the wants and needs of his discussion sections (and then structure his section accordingly). He is also very accommodating and presents information in clear and succinct ways, making sure that students who are struggling in lecture get caught up during his sections.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Ochsner, Fall 2022)</em></li>
<li>“Professor Silver is a genuinely kind and attentive instructor. He fosters an inclusive and supportive environment, taking individual differences into account during discussions. As someone who organizes thoughts and expresses ideas more slowly than some peers, I deeply appreciate how he ensures everyone has the opportunity to contribute meaningfully. This thoughtful approach makes the learning experience both enjoyable and empowering.” <em>(Psychology and the Internet, Instructor of record, Fall 2024)</em></li>
<li>“Nothing bad to say. Caring, attentive, great instructor&mdash;always willing to help and passionate on the subject matter. Felt safe, heard, and encouraged to give my best every class.” <em>(Psychology and the Internet, Instructor of record, Fall 2024)</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;I think Ben&rsquo;s greatest strength is his dedication to becoming a great teacher and continuing to learn and improve. He not only asked us for feedback but also acted on it. He adjusted the class based on what students needed most, dedicating more time to review the studies and concepts presented in class and even creating a link so students could submit questions anonymously.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Ochsner, Spring 2022)</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Ben is incredible! Best TA, hands down. Openly &ndash; truly openly&ndash; accepting of feedback. I appreciate his efforts to hear students, accommodate, and adjust.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Bolger, Spring 2021)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="student-understanding-of-course-concepts">Student understanding of course concepts</h3>
<p>The lab sections that I have taught thus far require a mixture of lecture and active learning. Across all of my teaching strategies, I place immense value in student understanding, and do my best to tailor my instruction to individual student needs. During lectures, I invite students to build concepts with me, through questions and class-generated examples. During group work, I listen and respond to the unique set of problems that each group faces, and tailor my teaching accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Ben is, hands down, THE BEST TA I&rsquo;ve ever had. He could teach an undergraduate course and do it well - that&rsquo;s how good he is. He speaks clearly, deliberately, and he commands the room in a warm, disarming way to boot. He displays leadership and authority when he teaches, and then he is able to step to the students&rsquo; level when speaking one on one or in small groups. He is disarming and truly caring. I am a huge fan of Ben as a teacher and a human. In lab, he taught well, he was intent on making sure we grasped the material and that we were growing, he was funny, and, most of all, he cared about each of the students&rsquo; growth.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Ochsner, Fall 2022)</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Best TA ever! Ben&rsquo;s lab sections were engaging and clear. He reviewed material from the lecture, answered questions, and led group activities to help us better understand the material covered in lecture. The R Studio tutorials were very helpful and Ben would go at the pace of the class, stopping to answer questions and go over the instructions again when necessary. He provided good, constructive feedback on class assignments and was always available to assist students when needed.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Ochsner, Spring 2022)</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Ben was a great TA! He is very knowledgeable and always willing to help us. He provides us the tool to be successful in this class. He is also very enthusiastic about this course and he makes it so easy to understand some difficult topics by explaining them thoroughly.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Ochsner, Fall 2022)</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Ben did something that I typically only see at higher levels, in career engagement -something that I do and love&ndash; he taught to the class! &ndash;Meaning he worked at the pace and understanding of his students, providing thorough feedback and ensuring that we all built a strong foundation. Without him I would not have been able to do this course in this way.&rdquo; <em>(Research Methods, Lab section instructor, Prof. Bolger, Spring 2021)</em></li>
<li>“Professor Silver&rsquo;s course is impressive, particularly because of the novel nature of his subject matter and the carefully selected weekly readings, which have been an eye-opener for me…The coding components of the course are another standout feature, as they are well-designed and highly practical, providing valuable hands-on experience.” <em>(Psychology and the Internet, Instructor of record, Fall 2024)</em></li>
