      <description>How would you react if you found out that your partner has been unfaithful? Or that the slacker in your high school class is now immensely successful? We make predictions about how people will act all the time - what happens when those predictions are wrong? In order to form cohesive representations of others, we often need to integrate conflicting information about them. Furthermore, our pre-existing feelings towards these people, as well as our motivations and goals, influence how and when we update our beliefs about them.</description>

      <description>We all have things that we&amp;rsquo;re interested in: Hobbies, favorite tv shows, topic areas we can&amp;rsquo;t learn enough about. Most of the time, we are able to inhibit our desires related to our interests - talking about them, thinking about them - when it is socially appropriate. Some children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are less able to modulate their thought patterns to match what is appropriate for the situation.</description>
